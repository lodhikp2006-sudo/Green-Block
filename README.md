# Green Block

## Project Description

Green Block is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that bridges environmental sustainability with decentralized finance. Our smart contract system enables users to create, fund, and manage green environmental projects while earning and trading carbon credits as digital assets. The platform incentivizes climate-positive actions through tokenized carbon credits, creating a transparent and efficient marketplace for environmental impact.

## Project Vision
